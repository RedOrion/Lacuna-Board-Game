<h1>Designing Board Games With Perl - Part 1</h1>

<p>Board games are hotter than they've ever been. In fact, <a
    href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/24066.html">the board game market
    has grown 25% in the past year while the video game market shrank 20%</a>.
But you're a Perl hacker, not an Adobe Illustrator, so how can you design a
board game? Well, that's exactly what I aim to show you in this article.</p>

<p>First, you need an idea. You can turn literally anything into a game.  <a

    href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/">The Game Crafter</a>, which itself
is written entirely in Perl. )</p>

<p>For the purposes of this article, I'm going to make <a
    href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/lacuna-expanse:-a-new-empire">a
    board game version</a> of the popular Perl-based web game <a
    href="http://www.lacunaexpanse.com">The Lacuna Expanse</a>. (I'm also one
of the owners of Lacuna.) I chose this because I already have some artwork for
it, albeit not in board game form. However, <a
    href="https://community.thegamecrafter.com/publish/file-preparation/art-resources">you
    can get free art from various sites around the web</a>.</p>


<p>My Lacuna-based board game will be a tile placement game where all the
players work together cooperatively to fend off an alien invasion.</p>

<h2>Let's Get To The Perl Already!</h2>

<p>There are several great image manipulation libraries on the CPAN, but my
personal favorite is <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~jcristy/PerlMagick-6.77/Magick.pm.in">Image::Magick</a>.
I started by creating a base image which I could manipulate in any way that I
wanted. (I based my choice off of <a
    href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/publish/pricing">The Game Crafter's 
    list of component sizes and prices</a>.) I decided to use <a
    href="https://community.thegamecrafter.com/publish/templates/cards/mini-cards">mini
    cards</a>, because the table would fill up too quickly with full
poker-sized cards; there'll be a lot of cards on the table!</p>

<pre><code> my $card = Image::Magick-&gt;new(size=&gt;'600x825');
 say $card-&gt;ReadImage('canvas:white');</code></pre>

Note that I used <code>say</code> in front of the <code>ReadImage</code> call.
<code>Image::Magick</code> will emit a textual exception on each call if
anything goes wrong. I could easily wrap that with better error handling, but
for now printing to the screen is sufficient for my needs.</p>

<p>When printing things (really <em>printing</em> them, with ink and all) you
also have to take into account something called <a
    href="http://youtu.be/NqZSFpmS2dM">bleed and cut lines</a>. It's easy to
draw the cut line on the card in red as the boundary of the printable image
content.</p>

<pre><code> say $card-&gt;Draw(stroke=&gt;'red', fill =&gt; 'none', strokewidth=&gt;1, primitive=&gt;'rectangle', points=&gt;'38,38 562,787');
</code></pre>

<img src="blank.jpg" alt="blank with cut lines">

<p>So far so good. The next step is to give this card a background so that it
starts to look like a card. For this I'll take one of the planet surface images
from the Lacuna Expanse and rotate it and stretch it to fit the shape of the
card.</p>

<pre><code> my $surface = Image::Magick-&gt;new;
 say $surface-&gt;ReadImage('surface-p17.jpg');
 say $surface-&gt;Rotate(90);
 say $surface-&gt;Resize('600x825!');
 say $card-&gt;Composite(compose =&gt; 'over', image =&gt; $surface, x =&gt; 0, y =&gt; 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Note the exclamation point (<strong>!</strong>) on the <code>Resize</code>
command. That tells <code>Image::Magick</code> to distort the native aspect
ratio of the image. In other words, stretch the image to fill the size I've
specified.</p>

<img src="background.jpg" alt="background">

<p>You may have noticed that this image looks enormous. That's because it's for
print (on paper!) rather than screens. Print has more <a
    href="http://proshooter.com/article_whatisa300dpiJPeg.htm">pixels per
    inch/centimeter</a> than screens, thus the image looks bigger when you
display it on a screen.</p>

<p>Now the card needs a title. Adding text to the image is straightforward.</p>

<pre><code> $card-&gt;Annotate(text =&gt; 'Mayhem Training', font =&gt; 'ALIEN5.ttf', y =&gt; -275, fill =&gt; 'white', pointsize =&gt; 70, gravity =&gt; 'Center');</code></pre>

<img src="title.jpg" alt="title">

<p>As you can see I've used a custom font. <code>Image::Magick</code> is
capable of using nearly any OpenType or TrueType font.</p>

<p>With a background and a title, the next step is to overlay the card with a
picture of the Mayhem Training building from the video game.</p>

<pre><code> my $image = Image::Magick-&gt;new;
 say $image-&gt;ReadImage('mayhemtraining9.png');
 say $card-&gt;Composite(compose =&gt; 'over', image =&gt; $image, x =&gt; 100, y =&gt; 165);</code></pre>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="added image">

<p>Now we're finally getting somewhere! This is really starting to look like a
card. Use the same technique to overlay an icon onto the card. As in so many
games, these icons symbolize an ability that the card grants the player who
uses it. You can get free icons from all over the web; one of my favorite
libraries is <a href="http://www.glyphish.com">Glyphish</a>.</p>

<pre><code> my $icon = Image::Magick-&gt;new; 
say $icon-&gt;ReadImage('target.png'); 
say $card-&gt;Composite(compose =&gt; 'over', image =&gt; $icon, x =&gt; 100, y =&gt; 570);</code></pre>

<img src="icon.jpg" alt="added icon">

<p>You can't get away with icons all the time; a little text will explain
things to new players. Adding some explanation to the card would be really
tricky, if it weren't for <a
    href="http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=3708">some
    really neat code that Gabe Schaffer contributed to the ImageMagick forums a
    long time ago</a>. Basically without this code you'd have to make the text
wrap at word boundaries yourself, but with it, you can just do a simple
<code>Annotate</code> call like this:</p>

<pre><code> $card-&gt;Set(font =&gt; 'promethean.ttf', pointsize =&gt; 35);
 my $text = 'Demolish one of your buildings to use this ability.';
 my $text_wrapped = wrap($text, $card, 400);
 say $card-&gt;Annotate(text =&gt; $text_wrapped, x =&gt; 100, y =&gt; 690, font =&gt; 'promethean.ttf', fill =&gt; 'white', pointsize =&gt; 35);
</code></pre>

<img src="text.jpg" alt="added text">

<p>A game like this wouldn't be very interesting if you could place any card
anywhere you want. To solve this, I want to to add something to the card to
indicate how other cards can connect to it. This is the most challenging part
yet, because I want to make a half-circle/half-rectangle connector. Because
this is a bit more complicated and I want to use it for drawing connection
points on various sides of the card, I'll turn it into a subroutine.</p>

<pre><code> sub draw_connection_point {
   my ($card, $color, $rotation, $x, $y) = @_;

   # draw a half circle, it's a half cuz we're drawing outide the image
   my $half_circle  = Image::Magick-&gt;new(size=&gt;'70x35');
   say $half_circle-&gt;ReadImage('canvas:transparent');
   say $half_circle-&gt;Draw(stroke =&gt; $color, fill =&gt; $color, strokewidth=&gt;1, primitive=&gt;'circle', points=&gt;'35,35, 35,70');

   # create the connection point image
   my $connection = Image::Magick-&gt;new(size=&gt;'70x85');
   say $connection-&gt;ReadImage('canvas:transparent');

   # add the half circle to the connection point
   say $connection-&gt;Composite(compose =&gt; 'over', image =&gt; $half_circle, x =&gt; 0, y =&gt; 0);

   # extend the connection point the the edge
   say $connection-&gt;Draw(stroke=&gt;$color, fill =&gt; $color, strokewidth=&gt;1, primitive=&gt;'rectangle', points=&gt;'0,35 70,85');

   # orient the connection point for its position
   say $connection-&gt;Rotate($rotation);

   # apply the connection point to the image
   say $card-&gt;Composite(compose =&gt; 'over', image =&gt; $connection, x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y);
 }

 draw_connection_point($card, 'purple', 0, 265, 740);</code></pre>

<img src="connection.jpg" alt="connection added">

<p>Sometimes it's nice to give players hints about stuff so they can form
better strategies. To that end, I added a series of pips above the title to
indicate how many copies of this card are in the deck. In this case, this card
is unique.</p>

<pre><code> my $quantity = 1;
 my $pips = '.' x $quantity;
 say $card-&gt;Annotate(text =&gt; $pips, y =&gt; -340, fill =&gt; 'white', pointsize =&gt; 70, gravity =&gt; 'Center');</code></pre>

<img src="finished.jpg" alt="finished">

<p>Remember to remove the cut line before you save the file.</p>

<pre><code>#say $card-&gt;Draw(stroke=&gt;'red', fill =&gt; 'none', strokewidth=&gt;1, primitive=&gt;'rectangle', points=&gt;'38,38 562,787');
 say $card-&gt;Write('mayhem.png');</code></pre>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Now that I've shown you how to create a card, you may have one question. Why
would you go through the work of coding it rather than just using Photoshop or
the Gimp? There are lots of reasons to code it including things like you don't
know how to use image editors. However the really important reason is the same
reason you write code to do anything... automation! A game isn't made of just
one card. Likewise, games aren't designed in just one try. It takes lots of
play testing and revisions. If you design your board game using code you can
whip out a new revision as easily as changing a config file.</p>

<p>Of course, automatic image generation isn't only for games....</p>

<h2>Next Time</h2>

<p>I've shown you how to create the images for a game. If you're like me, the
next thing you want to do is print your game. You could do this at home, but
it will cost you a lot of time and money (ink jet ink costs more than human
blood). You could take it to Kinkos, but you won't get a nice quality product
because they don't specialize in making games. Instead, you can upload your
files to <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com">The Game Crafter</a>, where
you'll get a custom game that looks like it game from the game store. There's a
nice easy to use web interface to do this, but you're a Perl programmer. Why do
something manually if you can automate it?</p>

<p>Besides that, it's a real-world example of interacting with a web service
written completely in Perl&mdash;on both sides. Who wouldn't be interested in
that?</p>
