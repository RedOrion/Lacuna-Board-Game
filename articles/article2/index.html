<h1>Designing Board Games With Perl - Part 2</h1>
<p>
In my last article I described how to create board game images using Image::Magick, thus allowing you to design board games using Perl. This time I want to show you how to upload those images to <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/">The Game Crafter</a> so you get get a professional copy of the game manufactured.
</p> 

<p>
In the last article we <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/lacuna-expanse:-a-new-empire">created a board game version</a> of the video game called <a href="http://www.lacunaexpanse.com">The Lacuna Expanse</a>. This time we'll learn how to upload those images to the site so we can create our own custom board game.
</p>

<h2>Getting Ready</h2>

<p>
First, get yourself a copy of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rizen/TheGameCrafter-Client/lib/TheGameCrafter/Client.pm">TheGameCrafter::Client</a>. It's a Perl module that makes it trivial to interact with The Game Crafter's RESTful web service API. When you <code>use TheGameCrafter::Client;</code> it imports <code>tgc_get()</code>, <code>tgc_post()</code>, <code>tgc_put()</code>, and <code>tgc_delete()</code> into your program for easy use. From there you can have a look at The Game Crafter's <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/developer/">developer documentation</a> to do any custom stuff you want.
</p>

<p>
You'll also need to activate the <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/account">developer setting in your TGC account</a>, and <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/account/apikeys">request an API key</a>.
</p>

<h2>A Little about The Game Crafter's API</h2>
<p>TheGameCrafter::Client is just a tiny wrapper around our RESTful web services. I designed the web services atop <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~xsawyerx/Dancer/lib/Dancer.pm">Dancer</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~frew/DBIx-Class/lib/DBIx/Class.pm">DBIx::Class</a>. My goal with this was to build a very reliable and consistent API not only for external use but internal. You see, the entire TGC web site actually runs off these web services. Not only that, but these web services tie directly into our manufacturing facility, so they are controlling the physical world in addition to the virtual. </p>
<p>
With Lacuna, I built <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rizen/JSON-RPC-Dispatcher/lib/JSON/RPC/Dispatcher.pm.orig">JSON::RPC::Dispatcher</a> (JRD), which is a JSON-RPC 2.0 web service handler on top of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/Plack/lib/Plack.pm">Plack</a>. I love JRD, but it has two weaknesses, one of them fatal. One weakness is that you must format parameters using JSON, which means that it's not easy to just call a URL and get a result with something like curl. The fatal weakness of JSON-RPC 2.0 is that ther is no way to do file uploads within the spec. The Game Crafter is all about file uploads, so that meant I either needed to handle those separately (aka inconsistently), or develop something new. I opted for the latter. 
</p>
<p>
With TGC's web services I decided to adopt some of the things I really liked about JSON-RPC, namely the way it handles responses whether they be result sets or errors. So you always get a consistent return:
<pre><code>{
   "error" : {
        "code" : 404,
        "message" : "File not found.",
        "data" : "file_id"
   }
}</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
With TGC I also wanted a consistent and easy way of turning DBIx::Class into web services through Dancer. I looked into things like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~oliver/Catalyst-Plugin-AutoCRUD-2.122460/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/AutoCRUD.pm">AutoCRUD</a>, but I'm not a fan of Catalyst, and it also took too much configuration (in my opinion) to get it working. I wanted something simpler and faster, so I decided to roll my own. The result was a thin layer of glue between Dancer and DBIx::Class that allows you to define your web service interface in your normal DBIx::Class declarations. It automatically then generates the web services, databases tables, web form handling, and more for you. This little glue layer is now in use in all web app development within <a href="http://www.plainblack.com">Plain Black</a>, and eventually we'll be releasing it onto CPAN for all to use for free. The best part of that is that you know you're getting a production-ready system because it's been running The Game Crafter and other sites for over a year now. More on that in a future article.
</p>

<h2>Let's Do This Thing Already</h2>

<p>
First we need to authenticate. 
<pre><code>
 my $session = tgc_post('session',{
   username    => 'me',
   password    => '123qwe',
   api_key_id  => 'abcdefhij',
 });
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Before we can start uploading, we should fetch our user account information because there are several pieces of info there that we can use.
<pre><code>
 my $user = tgc_get('user', {
   session_id	=> $session->{id},           # using our session to do stuff
});
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Now we can create a folder and upload our first file.
<pre><code>
 my $folder = tgc_post('folder', {
  session_id	=> $session->{id},
  name		=> 'Lacuna',
  user_id 	=> $user->{id},
  parent_id	=> $user->{root_folder_id},  # putting this in our home folder
 });

 my $file = tgc_post('file', {
  session_id	=> $session->{id},
  name		=> 'Mayhem Training',
  file		=> ['mayhem.png'],	     # the array ref signifies this is a file path
  folder_id	=> $folder->{id},            # putting it in the folder we just created
 });
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Assuming at this point we've uploaded all of our files, we can now build out our game. The Game Crafter has this notion of a "Designer", which is sort of like your very own publishing company. Games are attached to the designer, so first we need to create the designer, then we can create the game.
<pre><code>
 my $designer = tgc_post('designer', {
  session_id	=> $session->{id},
  user_id 	=> $user->{id},
  name		=> 'Lacuna Expanse Corp',
 });

 my $game = tgc_post('game', {
  session_id	=> $session->{id},
  designer_id	=> $designer->{id},
  name		=> 'Lacuna Expanse: A New Empire',
 });
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
And now we need to create our deck of cards. This is pretty straight forward just like before.
<pre><code>
 my $deck = tgc_post('minideck', {
  session_id	=> $session->{id},
  name		=> 'Planet',
  game_id	=> $game->{id},
 });

 my $card = tgc_post('minicard', {
  session_id	=> $session->{id},
  name		=> 'Mayhem Training',
  face_id	=> $file->{id},
  deck_id	=> $deck->{id},
 });
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
And just like that we've created a game and added a deck of cards to it. There are of course lots of other fancy things you can do with the API, but this should get you started. I wouldn't leave you hanging there, however. I've <a href="https://github.com/plainblack/Lacuna-Board-Game">open sourced the actual code</a> I used to create <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/lacuna-expanse:-a-new-empire">the Lacuna Expanse board game</a> so you'd have something to reference. There's also a <a href="https://community.thegamecrafter.com/forums/developers">developer's forum</a> if you have any questions. Good luck to you, and happy gaming!
